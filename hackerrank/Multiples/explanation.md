This challenge is about rounding grades according to a specific HackerLand University policy.

The rounding policy is as follows:

If the difference between the grade and the next multiple of 5 is less than 3, the grade is rounded up to the next multiple of 5.
If the grade is less than 40, there is no rounding, as the result will still be a failing grade.
For example:

If the grade is 73, it will be rounded up to 75, because the difference between 73 and 75 is 2, which is less than 3.
If the grade is 67, there is no rounding, because 67 is not less than 40.
If the grade is 38, it will be rounded up to 40, because 40 - 38 = 2, which is less than 3.
If the grade is 33, there is no rounding because it is less than 40.
The gradingStudents function receives a list of grades and returns the grades after rounding.

To implement this, you can follow these steps:

Go through each grade in the list.
Check if the grade is less than 40. If it is, don't round.
Otherwise, check whether the difference between the grade and the next multiple of 5 is less than 3. If it is, round the grade up to the next multiple of 5.
Otherwise, keep the grade as it is.
